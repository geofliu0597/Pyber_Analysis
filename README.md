# Module 5 Challenge - Pyber Analysis through Pandas and Matplotlib

## Overview of Project

This project was made to seperate the the ride-sharing data into different city types, and using that grouping to produce potentially actionable tables and graphs through the use of pandas and matplotlib libraries.

## Results

#### Ride-Share Data

From the data, we can see that there are a lot less ride-sharing going on in rural areas, which is probably directly correlated to the population of rural areas. Interestingly, the average fare per ride and fare per driver grows as population density decreases. This could be because rural areas tend to have locations that are more spread apart that cause the fare to tick higher per ride.

This very clearly shows that there is a lot more business in urban areas than there are in rural areas. This is a point of interest as it could be useful information as to whether or not they should market or grow more into rural areas. 


## Summary

As we can see from the above two figures, there is significantly more business in urban areas than there are in rural areas, despite being more profitable for the drivers and the company in those locations. We should run another analysis to see whether or not this decrease in business is caused by the generally lower population of rural areas (i.e. "Fares per Capita"). If not, then there is still a lot of room to grow in rural areas.
